		# Write all code to perform your method updates here within the infinite while loop
		# The infinite loop will terminate once timeout is reached
		# Do not try to bypass the timer check e.g. by using continue
		# It is very easy for us to detect such bypasses - severe penalties await
		
		# Please note that once timeout is reached, the code will simply return w, b
		# Thus, if you wish to return the average model (as we did for GD), you need to
		# make sure that w, b store the averages at all times
		# One way to do so is to define two new "running" variables w_run and b_run
		# Make all GD updates to w_run and b_run e.g. w_run = w_run - step * delw
		# Then use a running average formula to update w and b
		# w = (w * (t-1) + w_run)/t
		# b = (b * (t-1) + b_run)/t
		# This way, w and b will always store the average and can be returned at any time
		# w, b play the role of the "cumulative" variable in the lecture notebook
		# w_run, b_run play the role of the "theta" variable in the lecture notebook
