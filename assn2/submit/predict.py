# DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS METHOD OR ITS INPUT OUTPUT BEHAVIOR

# INPUT CONVENTION
# X: n x d matrix in csr_matrix format containing d-dim (sparse) features for n test data points
# k: the number of recommendations to return for each test data point in ranked order

# OUTPUT CONVENTION
# The method must return an n x k numpy nd-array (not numpy matrix or scipy matrix) of labels with the i-th row 
# containing k labels which it thinks are most appropriate for the i-th test point. Labels must be returned in 
# ranked order i.e. the label yPred[i][0] must be considered most appropriate followed by yPred[i][1] and so on

# CAUTION: Make sure that you return (yPred below) an n x k numpy (nd) array and not a numpy/scipy/sparse matrix
# The returned matrix will always be a dense matrix and it terribly slows things down to store it in csr format
# The evaluation code may misbehave and give unexpected results if an nd-array is not returned
